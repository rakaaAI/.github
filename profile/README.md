**Rakaa.ai** is a software-driven organization focused on designing, building, and maintaining **high-quality, production-grade systems** enhanced by modern AI and cloud technologies.

We prioritize **engineering discipline**, **clean architecture**, and **long-term maintainability** — not just experiments or demos.

---

## 💻 What We Do

We build and maintain software across the **entire development lifecycle**, from system design to deployment and monitoring.

Our core areas include:

- 🧱 **Backend Systems & APIs**  
  Scalable services designed for performance, reliability, and clarity.

- 🤖 **AI-powered Applications**  
  Practical AI features embedded into real products — not standalone gimmicks.

- ⚙️ **Automation & Developer Tooling**  
  Internal tools that improve developer velocity and operational efficiency.

- 🧠 **LLM-integrated Services**  
  Thoughtfully designed LLM usage with guardrails, observability, and cost awareness.

- ☁️ **Cloud-native & Distributed Systems**  
  Systems built to scale, deploy, and evolve in real-world environments.

Our work blends **traditional software engineering best practices** with modern AI capabilities.
